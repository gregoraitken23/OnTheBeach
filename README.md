# Technical Work For On The Beach

This was a fun one to work on!

I decided to build this in Storybook so we can use the playground to see how the individual components work alone.
these have been built as modularaly styled components so could be used together or on their own.

I have used Jest for testing molecules & organisms
Sass for styling components
Typescript for creating the components

If you have issues send me an email. Gregor.aitken@forwarddigital.co.uk

Once you have cloned the Repo:

## `npm i`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run storybook` to run the storybook instance

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run start` to run the UI where I have placed the component

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run test` 

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
